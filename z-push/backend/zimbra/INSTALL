==============  Z-Push-2 Zimbra Backend - Installation Notes - Release 70  ==============

**  RELEASE 70 is designed to work with Z-Push 2.5 or later  **

Z-PUSH 2.5.x is now stable - but is still under development - There is still the possibility 
that updates to Z-PUSH will break things in the ZIMBRA backend from time to time. Any
issues found should be reported on the Support Ticket Tracker on the SourceForge web site
https://sourceforge.net/p/zimbrabackend/support-requests/  They will be addressed as 
quickly as possible. 


SHOW YOUR APPRECIATION
If you would like to show your appreciation for the work that goes into this zimbra backend
please send a donation via 
https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=7X94XCP9A5ZYG&lc=IE&currency_code=EUR&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted


New For Release 65 and later. A bash shell script is being provided to simplify the basic deployment
of the zimbra backend. Instructions are as follows :-
Usage: zpzb-install NN - where NN is the Backend Release No
1. Login as root
2. Place this script and the latest downloaded zimbraNN.tgz file in the [z-push home]/backend directory.
3. chmod +700 zpzb-install.sh to make it executable
4. Execute the script by typing  ./zpzb-install.sh NN
     The latest zimbraNN.tgz will be extracted into a directory zimbraNN
     If there is an existing zimbra backend directory it will be backed up as zimbra.preNN
     The existing backend files will be replaced with the latest release files except for
     those files that contain user settings
     Owner and selinux permissions will be set on the folders/files to match those on z-push
5. Check the output for files that may not have been updated automatically and compare and update as appropriate

 
NEW For Release 63 and later. The code to recognise the UserAgent of various devices and to
enable multi-folder support where appropriate has been reworked. The configuration information
is now broken out into a separate file zimbraMultiFolderUAs.php. To add multi-folder support
for any new device simply edit this file and add a new line to the array, setting the appropriate
switches for the different folder types. An upcoming change to the z-push core will allow 
retrieval from the state files of the UserAgent for clients such as some Windows clients that do
not supply their UserAgent on every request. 


STARTING WITH Release 57 - SmartFolders ARE ENABLED BY DEFAULT 
If you are upgrading and wish to continue to use XML files, you need to ensure that you have
	define('ZIMBRA_SMART_FOLDERS',false);
in your zimbra backend config.php file. 


ZIMBRA 8.0 AND LATER - DoSFilter MUST whitelist z-push server
Assuming that z-push is not running on the same IP address as zimbra, if you are running
zimbra 8.0 or later, you MUST whitelist the IP Address of the z-push server to avoid 
connection issues. See http://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/DoSFilter
For 8.0.0-8.0.2 see 
http://www.zimbra.com/forums/announcements/60397-zcs-dosfilter-workaround-zcs-8-0-1-8-0-2-a.html
	

ZIMBRA 7.2 AND LATER - Configure Max SOAP Sessions per User
If you have users who have multiple devices synching against their account at the same time there is 
a potential issue with the number of allowed SOAP sessions per user. This was highlighted in a zimbra 
bugzilla ticket and was fixed in zimbra release 7.2 and later - where you can now increase the number. 
See https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=75338 ; Providing the ability to increase the number 
of Soap sessions. I set the value to 7 on my server and typically don't see the issue any more. 
Typical evidence of this problem is sync loops and content disappearing from the view pane of the Web 
client while a device is synching through activesync.


ZIMBRA 6.0.4 AND EARLIER - BROKEN WITH Z-Push 2
These releases of zimbra have a bug in the JSON output of commands that breaks the 
json_decode parser. If you wish to use z-push-2 with the zimbra backend you must update
to a newer zimbra release.  See zimbra bugzilla for details :- 
http://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=42867



NEW FOR RELEASE 57 & Later - Notes Support - Task Folders named "Notes" or "Notes?????"
Release 57 introduced support for synching StickyNotes. As zimbra does not have any native
Notes Folders (up to Zimbra 8) the decision was made to sync the Notes from the device to 
Tasks folders. Tasks can be created/updated at any time in any folder without the need for 
To/From addresses/etc. that would be required for an email. This makes the task data type 
a great match for synching with StickyNotes from the device. As a result of this change, any
existing Tasks folder that happens to have a name starting with "Notes" (case-insensitive)
will be treated as a Notes folder after installing Release 57 or later. If you have existing 
folders you do not want treated as Notes files, rename them before updating the backend.
A folder named "Notes" will be treated as the primary StickyNotes folder. Folders named 
"Notes????" will be treated as additional User StickyNotes folders. To date this functionality
has only been tested with an iPhone running iOS7. 



NEW FOR RELEASE 55 & Later - The archive also includes a zimbra specific config.php that 
should reside in the zimbra backend folder. Update this default version with your site 
specific ZIMBRA_xxxxxx settings. If you are updating an existing z-push-2 installation, 
once you have updated the zimbra/config.php file, edit the overall z-push-2 config.php 
and remove all the ZIMBRA_xxxxxx settings from that file. The only "zimbra" setting that 
should remain in the overall config.php file is the BACKEND_PROVIDER setting.
  
  
Install Z-Push-2 as per supplied instructions - Be sure to read the instructions as the 
installation defaults have changed from z-push 1.5.n

In the z-push-2 "backend" folder, make a new sub-folder called "zimbra"

Copy all the files from the archive to the "backend/zimbra" folder - *Note* - if you had
previously used an alpha/beta version of the backend, the utils.php file from that 
version should now be removed as it is no longer needed.

Read all the configuration option notes so you can decide what way you want to configure
your setup. Pay particular attention to SmartFolders and user.XML files - as they are 
mutually exclusive. 

If you intend to use user.XML files, create a "zimbra" folder in the z-push root folder
and set the permissions so that your web server can read it. You will need to create your
user.XML files in this folder.



Edit the file config.php in the z-push main folder

Find the backend provider initialization - and replace with Zimbra - as follows

    $BACKEND_PROVIDER = "BackendZimbra";

Add the appropriate zimbra configuration directives in accordance with your needs. 
See notes below, reproduced from the top of the zimbra.php file, for details of 
the various configuration directives. 


For the default timezone - in case your php timezone is not set correctly - you will
need to edit the file z-push2/lib/core/zpush.php  and search for the line

                date_default_timezone_set('Europe/Amsterdam');

Replace the timezone as required. 


When adding your account to your phone/device, DO NOT ENABLE SMS/Text Message Sync. 

For many Phones the default when talking to a server reporting AS14 protocol is to
turn on the option to sync SMS/Texts. Be sure to uncheck the option before saving your profile. 
zimbra as of release 7.2 does not have a way to store SMS messages so they cannot be synched.
If you inadvertantly set up your account with SMS sync turned on, remove the account and re-add 
it. The z-push team are working on a dummy sync scheme that will allow the phone to think it is 
synching SMS messages with a server that does not have the capability built in.


So - if SMS sync is going to cause problems - why report the server as AS14 ? - you might ask.

Besides SMS sync, AS14 also adds many other features above and beyond AS12.1 that make it worth 
the hassle of managing the SMS sync issues. It adds the ability to resolve recipients for emails, 
check free/busy times when creating appointments amongst others. 


* Config File   :   === Replace ===
*                   $BACKEND_PROVIDER = "BackendZimbra";
*
*                   === Add the appropriate directives from below as required for your setup ===
*                   === Url to access zimbra server - no trailing slash ===
*                   The ZIMBRA_URL should be set to the value of the setting publicURL on the zimbra 
*                   server configuration. This should allow requests to the mail server to be properly 
*                   routed/proxied as appropriate by zimbra.
*
*                   define('ZIMBRA_URL', 'http[s]://<zimbra url>');
*
*                   By default the zimbra backend does not enforce certificate validation for connections 
*                   to zimbra as many people run zimbra FOSS using self-signed certificates. If verification 
*                   is required uncomment the following options and set the values to true as required. 
*                   These flags were added for PHP 5.6 and later compatability as the PHP default changed to
*                   enforcing validation for cURL/stream contexts. If these flags are not set or are set to
*                   false the behaviour of the zimbra backend will be as it was prior to that PHP change.	
*                   define('ZIMBRA_SSL_VERIFYPEER', true);
*                   define('ZIMBRA_SSL_VERIFYHOST', true);
*                   
*                   When using external LDAP authentication zimbra can send a redirect page when the user
*                   attempts to login. In this case for z-push to work it is necessary to enable the option
*                   ZIMBRA_URL_ALLOW_REDIRECT. Simply uncomment the line below to enable it.	
*                   define('ZIMBRA_URL_ALLOW_REDIRECT', true); 
*                   
*                   By default, if the configured ZIMBRA_URL does not match the zimbraPublicURL then
*                   it will be overridden by the zimbraPublicURL. If there is some overriding reason
*                   to prevent this from happening (I can't think of one) then this can be disabled 
*                   by adding the directive 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_URL_OVERRIDE', true); 
*                   to the zimbra backend config.php file
*
*                   === If you intend to use user.XML files
*                   define('ZIMBRA_USER_DIR', 'zimbra');
*                   AND - As of Release 57 - you will need to disable SmartFolders (see below)
*                   define('ZIMBRA_SMART_FOLDERS',false);
*
*                   === To enable sync of contact pictures ===
*                   define('ZIMBRA_SYNC_CONTACT_PICTURES', true);
*
*                   === To enable virtual contacts/appointments/tasks ===
*                   ActiveSync clients by default only allows a single Calendar, Contacts folder, 
*                   and Tasks folder to sync to the device. Apple have found a way around this and
*                   natively support multiple folders. If you enable VIRTUAL folders with these 
*                   these directives, then all appointments from other calendars for example will 
*                   be virtually included in the primary Calendar so they will sync to the device. 
*                   On zimbra they will remain separate. There is no way on the device to distinguish
*                   which appointments came from which Calendar folder. 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_VIRTUAL_CONTACTS',true);
*                   define('ZIMBRA_VIRTUAL_APPOINTMENTS',true);
*                   define('ZIMBRA_VIRTUAL_TASKS',true);
*                   define('ZIMBRA_VIRTUAL_NOTES',true);
*
*                   === To prevent sync of the "emailed contacts" folder
*                   define('ZIMBRA_IGNORE_EMAILED_CONTACTS',true);
*
*                   === To enable HTML email for MIME supporting devices - mainly Apple iPxxx ===
*                   define('ZIMBRA_HTML',true);
*
*                   === To ensure that the device uses a valid zimbra email address for the account ===
*                   define('ZIMBRA_ENFORCE_VALID_EMAIL',true);
*
*                   NOTE: As of Release 57 - Smart Folders are now ENABLED BY DEFAULT
*                   === To DISABLE the Smart Folders feature ===
*                   NOTE: Disabling SmartFolders will ALLOW user.XML processing
*                         It will also rename/resequence folder ID's in the state file for
*                         the device - so some resyncing will occur
*                   define('ZIMBRA_SMART_FOLDERS',false); 
*
*                   === To Disable Sync of any Folder Type System-wide ===
*                   Add the appropriate definition from this block, and set it true
*                   NOTE: Devices will need a full-resync to remove the unwanted content
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_MESSAGES',true); 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_CONTACTS',true); 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_APPOINTMENTS',true); 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_TASKS',true); 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_NOTES',true); 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_DOCUMENTS',true); 
*
*                   === To Enable Login Retries When Host Cannot Be Contacted ===
*                   If, for example, you shutdown zimbra to perform maintenance or backups
*                   and you find your clients (android in particular) are just giving up 
*                   too quickly on trying to reconnect, enable this setting and set it to
*                   whatever value is appropriate for your environment.
*                   A setting of 5 means zimbra.php will make 5 retry attempts, each one
*                   following a 60 second sleep. If all 6 attempts fail an error will be
*                   returned to the phone. The phone should then retry a number of times 
*                   itself. Monitor thread usage to make sure you don't run too many. 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_RETRIES_ON_HOST_CONNECT_ERROR',5);
*
*                   === To Enable Debug Information for ALL users ===
*                   This will output the Folder Lists from Setup() and the SOAP Requests/Responses
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DEBUG',true); 
*
*                   === To Enable Debug Information for selected user(s) ===
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DEBUG','user1,user2'); 
*
*                   === To Disable Debug Information ===
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DEBUG',false); 
*
*                   === To Define a Custom MB String Detect Order ===
*                   In case the default mb_detect_order of 'ASCII, UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-15'
*                   does not work for your region (eg Japan) you can override it with this setting
*                   adding your own encodings in the appropriate sequence. See PHP documentation for
*                   mb_detect_order for details. Be careful of the sequence of charsets.
*                   define('ZIMBRA_MB_DETECT_ORDER','ASCII, ISO-2022-JP, UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-15'); 
*
*
*                   === FOR z-push-2 ONLY - Local Message Cache ===
*                   For z-push-2 added local caching of MessageLists to reduce server load on
*                   initial sync where the same unchanged lists will be queried repeatedly 
*                   within a short space of time. The default is for this feature to be enabled
*                   with each folder cache having a lifetime of 3600 seconds.
*                   
*                   This feature is enabled by default - but can be disabled by adding a new 
*                   config.php directive 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_LOCAL_CACHE', false);
*                   
*                   The cache for each folder has a default lifetime of 3600 seconds. This can 
*                   be adjusted	by adding an additional directive
*                   define('ZIMBRA_LOCAL_CACHE_LIFETIME', 300);
*
*
*                   === To Enable Sending of Calendar Invites/Replies ===
*                   For z-push-2 added a configuration parameter to specify if the server should
*                   send Calendar Invites/Replies. As most modern devices now send the invitations
*                   and replies directly to the addressees, this is assumed to be false. In order to 
*                   change the setting, add the following parameter to the zimbra backend config.php 
*                   and set the value to true. This parameter replaces the old logic that made the 
*                   decision based on the client being Apple or not. 
*                   (Note: With SmartFolders this setting can be overridden per device - see below)
*                   define('ZIMBRA_SERVER_INVITE_REPLY', true);
*
*
* Feature Disable:  Several users have asked over time if it is possible to turn off Email sync or
*                   Calendar sync for an entire installation. Up to now it has only been possible
*                   through a hack to force all users to read a particular XML file.
*                   
*                   This release makes it possible to turn off individual folder types through the 
*                   config file. Enabling any of these switches will turn off that folder type (for 
*                   example email) for every user of the system. It will prevent all users from 
*                   syncing their email to their mobile devices.
*                   
*                   The default setting remains that these switches are either not present - or are 
*                   set to false - in which case all folder types will be available for synching.
*                   
*                   === To Disable Sync of any Folder Type System-wide ===
*                   Add the appropriate definition from this block to config.php, and set it true
*                   NOTE: Devices will need a full-resync to remove the unwanted content
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_MESSAGES',true); 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_CONTACTS',true); 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_APPOINTMENTS',true); 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_TASKS',true); 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_NOTES',true); 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_DOCUMENTS',true); 
*                   
*                   === To Disable the breaking out of Calendars and Contact Groups on devices ===
*                   Prior to Release 57 it was only Apple devices that were known to support the display 
*                   of multiple zimbra calendars - each with it's own colouring. 
*                   Release 57 now also enabled multi Calendar/Task folder support for Outlook 2013 and
*                   the Windows 8+ WindowsMail client. These clients do not support multiple Contact
*                   groups though - so virtual contact still need to be used for them.
*                   By default, if an Apple device is identified, Calendars/Contacts & Tasks in custom
*                   folders will be passed to the device in separate calendars/folders. This allows the
*                   device user to select what they want to display. 
*                   In order to prevent devices synching many different folders, the administrator can 
*                   disable the support of multiple calendars and/or multiple contact folder using these 
*                   configuration settings. 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_MULTI_CALENDARS',true); 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_MULTI_CONTACT_GROUPS',true); 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_MULTI_TASK_LISTS',true); 
*                   define('ZIMBRA_DISABLE_MULTI_NOTE_LISTS',true); 
*                   Note that if any 'Multi' feature is disabled, the behaviour of the backend will return to 
*                   that which was in place before the breakout ability was added. i.e. all items will get
*                   virtually included in the primary folder (assuming virtual support is turned on)
*
*
* SmartFolders:     Starting from Release 57 - SmartFolders is enabled by default. You must specifically
*                   disable the feature if you wish to use XML files.
*                   
*                   Historically in the zimbra backend, there has been the ability to manipulate the 
*                   number and types of folders that could be synced for an individual user through the  
*                   use of user.XML configuration files. While this worked well, it meant that the system 
*                   administrator had to be involved in every change for every user. 
*                   
*                   The introduction of SmartFolders as an alternative to XML files made it easy for users
*                   to manipulate their syncing content themselves by simply renaming folders in the Zimbra
*                   Web Client.
*                   
*                   Note that SmartFolders and XML files are mutually exclusive on the server. As of Release
*                   57 SmartFolders MUST BE DISABLED in order to allow the use of user.XML files. 
*                   
*                   To DISABLE the feature set ZIMBRA_SMART_FOLDERS to false in config.php
*                   
*                   When enabled, the final character in a folders name can take on special meanings as 
*                   follows :-
*                    "-" Do not include this folder or any sub-folders thereof
*                    "." Include this folder - But do not include any sub-folders thereof
*                   
*                   So for example you might have a top level folder called "Archive-" into which you  
*                   move all old folders that you do not want to be able to see from your device.
*                   
*                   Or you might have a "ToBeFiled." folder that contains a number of child folders used
*                   for longer term storage of reference emails. Naming it with a period (.) on the end
*                   will allow you to see that folder on your phone - so you can move emails in there to
*                   clear your Inbox - and then when you get to your desktop you can file all the emails
*                   into the appropriate child folders. 
*                   
*                   NOTE: As of Release 57 - Smart Folders are now ENABLED BY DEFAULT
*                   === To DISABLE the Smart Folders feature ===
*                   NOTE: Disabling SmartFolders will ALLOW user.XML processing
*                         It will also rename/resequence folder ID's in the state file for
*                         the device - so some resynching will occur
*                   define('ZIMBRA_SMART_FOLDERS', false); 
*                   
*                   User control of Folder types
*                   ----------------------------
*                   NOTE: z-push does not do hierarchy resync properly at this time - so if a user wishes 
*                   to make changes to their sync rules using the following directives, they should first
*                   remove the sync account from their phone - then make the changes - then re-add the 
*                   account to their phone. 
*                   
*                   When SmartFolders are configured, in instances where individual users wish to disable 
*                   particular folder types from syncing to their devices, a special top-level folder 
*                   structure can be used to configure those options. This provides the major filtering
*                   capability that would have been available through user.XML files. 
*                   
*                   If a folder named '*SyncConfig*' is found, the system will use any child folders in
*                   that folder to configure options. 
*                   
*                   The names of the sub-folders will be interpreted as configuration directives.
*                   
*                   These should have the format of 
*                   <folder type>&<setting=value>[&<setting=value>& ...]
*                   
*                   <folder type> can be any one of message, contact, appointment, task, note and 
*                   <setting=value> can be any one of 
*                   active=true/false - active=false will disable sync of that folder type
*                   virtual=true/false - virtual=false will turn of sync of additional folders (not
*                                        applicable for message type)
*                   primary=FolderName - setting primary will override the default primary folder for
*                                        that content type (Inbox, Contacts, Calendar, Tasks)
*                   
*                   So, for example, you could have 
*                   
*                   *SyncConfig* 
*                      message&active=false            to disable email sync
*                      task&active=true&virtual=false  to limit the task sync to the default primary folder
*                      appointment&active=true&virtual=false&primary=WorkCalendar  to limit 
*                                                       appointment sync to the WorkCalendar folder
*                      
*                   The *SyncConfig* folder, and it's contents will never be synced to the phone so
*                   long as ZIMBRA_SMART_FOLDERS is set to true.
*                   
*                   User control of Mobile Sender Name
*                   ----------------------------------
*                   In case the user's display name contains non-ascii characters, and it gets corrupted
*                   when sending emails from the device, a sendasname directive can be used to provide a
*                   MIME-encoded Sender Name to be used by the backend.
*
*                   To get the correctly formatted name, send yourself an email through the web
*                   client, and then right-click on the received email and Show Original. Look for
*                   the From: header and copy the name from there. Don't include the email address
*                   part - or any surrounding "" marks. Note that the encoding zimbra uses will most
*                   likely be utf-8 rather than ISO-8859-1 as seen in the following example
*
*                   For example 
*
*                   *SyncConfig* 
*                      sendasname&=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Andr=E9?= Pirard 
*                   The example above is taken from the rfc2047 document, and appears in a CC:
*                   CC: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Andr=E9?= Pirard <PIRARD@vm1.ulg.ac.be>
*                   For reference: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2047.html
*
*                   User control of Mobile Sender Email Address
*                   -------------------------------------------
*                   In case the user wishes to override their default email address when sending emails
*                   from the device, a sendasemail directive can be used to provide an alternative 
*                   email address
*
*                   For example 
*
*                   *SyncConfig* 
*                      sendasemail&john.doe@whatever.com
*
*                   Note: If ZIMBRA_ENFORCE_VALID_EMAIL is true, this address will be ignored if it
*                         has not been defined as a valid alias for the user on the zimbra server
*
*
*                   User control of Server Originated Calendar Invites/Replies
*                   ----------------------------------------------------------
*                   In case the user wishes to override the server setting for sending Calendar 
*                   Invites/Replies from the server they can add a serverinvitereply directive. 
*                   The user can then turn on or off the setting for one or more devices by 
*                   specifying each deviceID and a true/false value
*
*                   For example 
*
*                   *SyncConfig* 
*                      serverinvitereply&deviceid1=true&deviceid2=false
*
*                   It is only necessary to list devices for which the user wishes to override the 
*                   server default setting
*
*
* User Files    :   NOTE THAT USER FILES ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE FROM SMART FOLDERS
*
*                   The user files are to be saved in the location specified for ZIMBRA_USER_DIR.
*                   This must be a subdirectory for the base directory.  Each user file must be named
*                   using the user's user ID (not their email address) from Zimbra and have the file
*                   extension .xml.  Make sure the files have read permission.
*
*                   WARNING: Before changing the content of a User's XML file, set the sync schedule to
*                   manual on the device, or remove the profile entirely. And when finished, if the
*                   profile was not first removed then request a full-resync of the client before
*                   changing back to an automatic sync schedule.
*                   Explanation: User files effectively fool the device into thinking that some folders
*                   on the server that the device would normally see do not exist - AND/OR - that some
*                   folders that the device would not normally see are actually available to it. As a
*                   result, changing the contents of the XML file should not be done without doing a 
*                   full resync of the device. In the absence of doing this problems can occur that
*                   could lead to the loss of data on the server.
*                   For example - removing an include for a folder will make the device think the 
*                   folder has been deleted, and will trigger a delete for the client. This delete will
*                   cause a change-in-state on the client that will trigger a parallel delete on the
*                   server on the next sync. This will then delete the real server copy of that folder
*                   which would result in the loss of data.
*                   Making the changes offline, followed by a full-resync eliminates this risk.
*
*                   SendAsName and SendAsEmail are used for the organizer of appointments.
*
*                   Multiple profiles are supported for a single user.  For example, if a user has two
*                   devices and wants one set of folders and one particular calendar on one device and
*                   a different set of folders and a different calendar on the other, the user can
*                   accomplish this by using profiles.  To determine which profile the device users,
*                   specify the profile ID in the domain when setting up the account (See also roaming/
*                   timezone setting below).  Z-Push doesn't care what value is entered for a domain.
*                   If the ID is left blank for a profile, this is assumed to be the default.
*
*                   For each component, only use exclude or include, not both.  If exclude is used,
*                   all folders are included except those marked as excluded.  If include is used,
*                   only those folders specified are included.  The preference is to specify folders
*                   by their ID but since this isn't easy to do, name is acceptable.  However, it must
*                   be the same way througout: don't specify some folders by ID and others by name. If
*                   recursive is set to true, all child folders will be included/excluded.
*
*                   WARNING: If any folder names have an ampersand in them, you must use &amp;

*                   </zimbrabackend>
*
*                   Release 64 added a new capability - to define a global settings file to be used by
*                   default for all users. For example adding the new setting
*                   define('ZIMBRA_USER_XML_DEFAULT','default.xml');
*                   to the zimbra config.php file will apply the settings in default.xml to every user
*                   unless they have a specific file created for their account. 
*                   Note that sendasname and sendasemail are not supported in the global file. Also, note
*                   that if a specific file is created for the user it will be used instead of the default 
*                   file - the settings are not additive.
*
* Timezones     :   To handle the situation where a user is not in the same timezone as the zimbra server
*                   whether just roaming, or on a permanent basis, the user can specify their current 
*                   timezone in the domain field when setting up the account (see also profile identifier
*                   above). Refer to the php timezones list (http://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php)
*                   Specify the preferred timezone in the domain field using @Region/City. 
*                   Note: If used in conjunction with the profile identifier, specify the combined
*                   information as profileId@Region/City
*
* Zimbra 5      :   The timezone handling built into this PHP script is for the new standard timezone
* Compatability :   definitions used by zimbra 6 - details as listed above. However, there are still some
*                   people using zimbra 5.0.xx and that version used a completely different methodology
*                   for handling timezones. Zimbra 5 shipped with a file called timezones.ics located in 
*                   /opt/zimbra/conf/ - this file contains definitions of all the usable timezones. 
*
*                   In order to provide compatability between this script and zimbra 5, a new lookup file
*                   has been added for 5.0 users called v5timezone.xml, which should be copied to the 
*                   z-push/backend/ folder with the zimbra.php script. The format of the file is
*                   <zimbratimezones>
*                   	<timezone	id="Europe/Dublin"	v5id="(GMT) Greenwich Mean Time - Dublin / Edinburgh / Lisbon / London" />
*                   	<timezone	id="Europe/London"	v5id="(GMT) Greenwich Mean Time - Dublin / Edinburgh / Lisbon / London" />
*                      	<timezone	id="Europe/Paris"	v5id="(GMT+01.00) Brussels / Copenhagen / Madrid / Paris" />
*                   </zimbratimezones>
*                   where id="" is the zimbra 6 timezone, and v5id="" is the timezones.ics equivalent 
*                   from zimbra 5.
*
*                   These are the only 3 timezones added to the shipped version of the file. If you want 
*                   add timezones for your particular region, please refer to both timezones.ics on your 
*                   zimbra 5 server, and http://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php to map the additional 
*                   timezones. If people want to post their timezones up on a thread on the support forum
*                   on sourceforge, we can possibly add additional ones to the shipped file going forward.
*
*                   In order to use the compatability fix, it must be possible for this script to find
*                   your preferred timezone in v6 format. So, it must be defined in the @Region/City 
*                   format in your domain field (see above) or in the Region/City format in a user.XML file
*                   (see above) or it must be possible to lookup your default in the v5timezone.xml file
*                   using your v5 preferred timezone as returned by zimbra. 
*
*                   Please search the log file for "NOT FOUND in v5timezone.xml" after turning on z-push
*                   with v5 in order to make sure you have defined all the timezones you need.
*
* RTF fields    :   To handle RTF fields in appointment/task/contact where no Body field is received
*                   zimbra.php requires z_RTF.php include file from as12 branch of z-push SVN to decode
*                   the Compressed RTF stream. This situation can commonly occur with non-English clients
*
* PHP.ini File  :   === Replace ===
*                   max_execution_time = 120      (Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds)
*                   memory_limit = 256M           (Maximum amount of memory a script may consume)
